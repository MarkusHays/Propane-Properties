# Propane-Properties
This program calculates the density of propane for both liquid and vapor phase using the 
modified Benedict-Webb-Ruben EOS proposed by Starling in his book "Fluid Thermodynamic 
Properties for Light Petroleum Systems". 

The main features of the program at this point is: 

1) A single density and phase type calculation at a given pressure (p) and temperature (T) 
in the function called "single_density_calc()"

2) Calculate the density at a variaty of pressures and temperatures using the function called 
"calc_density_heatmap"

Intro on EOS models in generatl (IGL, RGL, vdW, cubic, BWR and finally modified BWR)
